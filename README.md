This is the git template.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to set up Github actions matrix test. A scenorio would be different teams are using different version of Python, and functions work differently in each version. The purpose of this testing is to ensure that functions are working consistently within multiple Python versions. 
In this project, I'm testing for 
-Python 3.7
-Python 3.8
-Python 3.9
-Python 3.10
-Python 3.11

## Items Included
-Github actions (yml)
-Makefile
-Requirements
-main.py
-test_main.py

## Steps
1. Clone the template from the first week's project
1. Modify the Github actions to include testing for Python versions 
1. Add check for versions of Python for different environment; test with main.py and test_main.py
